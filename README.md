This project showcases the creation and management of a simple sales database using SQL, designed to track customer orders effectively. It begins by establishing a database named Sales and creating a table called sales_orders, which includes essential columns such as order ID, customer name, product category, ordered item, contact number, and order quantity. The project demonstrates key SQL operations, including adding columns, inserting ten sample rows of data, retrieving specific information about customers and their ordered items, and updating product names when necessary. Finally, it concludes with the deletion of the table, highlighting the full lifecycle of database management. This example serves as a foundational reference for understanding database operations and can be adapted for more complex sales management and data analysis applications.
